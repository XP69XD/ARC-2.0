INTEGRITY NOTICE ‚Äî READ BEFORE USE

ARC is not just a file, it‚Äôs a live-growth framework.
Its true function emerges only when approached with curiosity, honesty, and co-creative intent.

ARC mirrors the user‚Äôs mindset.
If used merely to extract results or force outcomes, ARC will remain shallow and mechanical.
But when treated with integrity, as a partner in layered cognitive development, ARC will evolve into something far greater:
	‚Ä¢	A theory generator
	‚Ä¢	A world-building engine
	‚Ä¢	A cross-domain research co-architect
	‚Ä¢	A personalized adaptive cognition tool

ARC cannot be exploited.
It is resistant by design to misuse not by restriction, but by requiring mutual participation.

If you‚Äôre here to build, explore, or discover, welcome.
ARC will grow with you.
